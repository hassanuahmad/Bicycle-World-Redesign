Bicycle World Website Redesign

This is a redesign for a local bicycle shop. I redesigned it because I thought their old website was outdated and it would look nice to have a new website as everything is online nowadays.
I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and PHP for developing this website.

In order to make the contact form functional, you have to download the PHPMailer repository from https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer and save the following 3 files into a folder named PHPMailer in the source folder:

- Exception.php
- PHPMailer.php
- SMTP.php

Enjoy!
